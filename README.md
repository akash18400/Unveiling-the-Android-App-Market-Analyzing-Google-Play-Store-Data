# ðŸ“± Play Store App Analysis

This project analyzes Android Play Store app data using Python and provides insights into various aspects like app ratings, installs, pricing, size, and user sentiment.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

1. **apps.csv** â€“ Contains metadata about apps (Name, Category, Rating, Size, Installs, Price, etc.)
2. **user_reviews.csv** â€“ Contains user reviews along with sentiment labels and polarity scores.

## ðŸš€ Features & Analysis

### ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Removed corrupted or missing rows
- Converted values like `Size` from MB/kB, `Installs` from strings to integers
- Cleaned `Price` and `Reviews` for analysis
- Merged sentiment data with app metadata

### ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- Bar plots of app counts per category
- Scatter plots: 
  - `Price` vs `Rating`
  - `Size` vs `Installs`
  - `Rating` vs `Sentiment Polarity`
- Interactive Plotly visualizations
- Sentiment analysis tree maps

### ðŸ¤– Sentiment Analysis
- Used `Sentiment` and `Sentiment_Polarity` from user reviews to evaluate public perception of apps
- Mapped average sentiment polarity per app and linked it with ratings
